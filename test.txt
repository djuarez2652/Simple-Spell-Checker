Computers aer amazing machines, they do so many thing! The mouse and keyboar are the main input deviecs, without them, it's impossible to do anything. The CPU, or centrl processing unit, is like the brian of the computer, it's where all the magic happens. There are different kinds of computrs, like laptops, desktops, and even smat phones. The RAM is what stores all the files temprarily, and the hard drive stores them permanetly. When you want to open a program, you click on the icon and it starts right away. The internt is a wonderful place, it connects people from all around the wolrd. I likes to play video games on my computer, it's so fun! Computers have revolutinized the way we live, and it's hard to imagine a world without them.
